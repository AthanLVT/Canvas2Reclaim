# Canvas2Reclaim
Take Canvas Assignments and automatically adds them to reclaim.ai task list with proper due dates and such.


- Will take due dates and unlock dates off of canvas using sign in key provided by user.

  
- Additional file containing the average length of assignment of similar types.
  For Example: If you have an assignment called "Circuits HW5", the user can enter the average time to complete the assignment for all "Circuits HW_" and the tool will enter it into reclaim.
  ~ If there is no common assignments, the program will simply ask the user before it is entered into reclaim, or it will use the default value (1hr).
  ~ this file can be changed at any time.
  ~ Maybe add a function that predicts the required time based off of previous assignments times taken?
